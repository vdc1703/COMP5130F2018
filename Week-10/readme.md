- Finished Login/Logout

**Problem**

The Weblab.cs.uml.edu server is currently run PHP 5.4. This is cause me a trouble to run the upload file and alsoe save file to directory. Moreover, the server is seem like not let me upload the file.

**Problem Solving**

I worked with Tuyen, who is System Manger of CS Deparment. He helped me update the PHP 5.4 to PHP 5.5 on server which helped me solved one problem. Other problem is save the upload file which I still working on to see any thing else I can do.
