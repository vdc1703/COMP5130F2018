**Problem**

I was have a hard time with PHP functions. The upload.php can't run. Error on "!empty(array_filter($_FILES['files']['name']))" function.

**Problem Solving**

After do a research, I find out that I need to upgrade my PHP version. I currently run PHP 5.4.4 so after I upgrade to 5.6.38. The problem is solved.

I currently work on image slide. There is a test.php is what I'm working on for Gallery Slide.
