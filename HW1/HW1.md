**Question:** Open 1 startup and solve problem!!!

**Reason:**

My sister in law opened a nail salon. She has about 10 employees whom are working for her, but they all have different schedules. They may work in difference days and difference hours. Also, there are few rules for taking turns and to compensate employees. For example, If I was the first person who get to the salon, I would check in at the time so that I can take the very first customer. That applies to everyone else as well. Her employee will be compensated depend on how the customer pay for the service. The customers could pay with credits or cash. If it is cash, then the employee may earn more than paid by credit card because due to the transactions fee and all other services from credit cards. By the end of the day, she will calculate all the transactions and determine how much each employee earned because there are difference services which difference prices.

Right now, everything she does is by hand. It takes a lot of her time and not database recorded. It will take her more time if she wants to look back at the history.

**Solution:**

By that, I want to create a website in which every employee can gain access to. The employee would punch in what they have done during the day and how much they charged each customer. By the end of the day, it will automatically calculate and give my sister a report how much each employee made for the day. It will also save it to the database server, so she can look back in the future. She just needs to open the report again and all the information will be there.

My solution right now is using MySQL to store my data. But I havenâ€™t decided which Web Development language I would use to write the site. Linux server will be best since the hosting for Linux is cheaper than the Windows.
