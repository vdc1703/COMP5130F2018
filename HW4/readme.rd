**Assignment 4**

I’m not sure this is too late or not. But I’m changing my project now. The old idea is for accounting website, but I see that there are a lot of accounting website already. So, I think about a difference one, I want to make an Image Gallery website. 
I love take photo with my own professional camera. I have a lot of picture that I have been taking over the years and I want to share it to everyone. So, create a website that put all my picture on and everyone can just visit my website and can see any photo. 

Why I do this?
I know there are a lot of Image Gallery on internet, but they are limited feature and if I want to get exactly what I want, I will have to pay for it. Since I can create my own, why don’t I do it and moreover, I can release this to public for free use also.
My idea for the website will be.

**Image Gallery**
**Current:**
-	PHP language
-	Automatic create thumbnails
-	Auto resize images (I will make the max size is 1024x768 due to storage space)
-	Upload image via FTP or web interface
-	Upload image, folder or zip file
-	Option Watermark for each photo
-	Each photo will display all information about a picture based on their detail’s property.
-	Folder tree on website for each album 

**Future feature:**
-	“Like” option for each photo
-	Edit photo to difference color/effect.
-	Admin and User account
-	User webpage for their own albums.

With the PHP, it will automatic read all the photo from a folder and display on website, so I don’t have to manually add every single photo to the website.
