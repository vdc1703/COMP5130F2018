**Chuong Vu**

**Week 12**


Weblab link: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~cvu/COMP5130/Week-12/root/


**Completed**

- Rework the Upload function. Allow user to drag and drop photos


**Problem**

- Can not do select all check box using jquery
- A bit confusing between bootstrap 3 and bootstrap 4 class such as 'col-md-' etc...


**Problem Solving**

- I do select all checkbox by writing correct class name of select box
- Recheck bootstrap 4 documentation


**Note**

- For the .htaccess, I still can't make the weblab run as I expect. Most of the functions is not running correctly due to the rewrite module not accessable on Weblab. I know this will be the problem because Weblab is a share host with other students. I need to more secure so the server will not be hack.
