**Chuong Vu**

**Week 6**

Weblab link: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~cvu/COMP5130/Week-6/root/

**Completed**

- Auto resize images from images in folder.
- Create thumbnails and put it in cache folder for use to display on pre-slide
- Slide-show is ok, but kind of slow.

**Problem**

My problem for this part mostly is time spending for research on auto resize. There are many way and example for PHP to do auto resize and thumbnails but I need to get one that fit into my case.


**Next**

So far, I got most of the basic functions of images gallery is done. Hope in the next update, I can be able to add the database for user login and register. Along with user upload their own image gallery.
