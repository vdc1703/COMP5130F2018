**Week 3**

**Completed**
Able to create index.php file with run some simple basic PHP code and know how to link PHP code from the different place together.

**Problem**
Planning, thinking and working is so much difference. When I was planning the website, I thought it should be easy to create an website with PHP. However, when I tried to write a PHP website, it not that easy. I have to find out how to make a PHP webserver. I follow the tutorial on w3school.com, created an simple index.php and run it but it did not show anything but the code in a text form. PHP is not like HTML which only need the browser support to run. PHP do need a server-side scripting language to support it to run. I have already install the XAMPP which is support the PHP on Windows Desktop. However, I do need do some configuration on my Windows to make it run. Not like on the weblab.cs.uml.edu which is already setup and up to run.

**Problem Solving**
After configured and be able to run on my Windows. I was able to created a simple PHP webpage. So then I created webpage with dynamic input forms from user using PHP language.

My first impressed with php is it run fast. I tried to create dynamic input forms with JavaScript, it take a little more time since the HTML webpage need to run first and then it execute the JavaScript. But the php is run directly on it webpage so it fast. Moreover, when I there is something wrong, the webpage will not display properly, it will only show the error and tell me where I do wrong and what line of code I need to fix. This is really helpful for programmer to troubleshoot the code.
