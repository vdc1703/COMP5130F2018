**Chuong Vu**

**Week 4**

Weblab link: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~cvu/COMP5130/Week-4/root/

**Completed**
Successed created MySQL database and use PHP to get data from the database.

**Problem**
I had a hard time to config the MySQL on the Weblab server since there are no User Interface like XAMMP. I have to work with CS Helpdesk to help me out how to use the command line to create and import database.

**Problem Solving**
I was able to get the user from database that I created. Also, user page is created dynamic using only user.php and user ID.

I still playing with PHP and dymanic feature that PHP bring here. However, what I see is this is too simple and the source code will not work for a bigger project. I have to redesign the database and also I will based on some template that I see on the internet to help me out.
