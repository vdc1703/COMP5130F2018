**Chuong Vu**

**Week 5**

Weblab link: http://weblab.cs.uml.edu/~cvu/COMP5130/Week-5/root/

**Completed**

- Scan folder and link it on the homepage
- List all the images inside the folder

I have completed the start point for the webpage. There many thing I still have not done yet like resize, thumbnails, etc...


**Problem**

I have a hard time with the weblab and my localhost. The XAMMP using PHP7 while Weblab only run PHP5, this make my website not able to run on Weblab.
