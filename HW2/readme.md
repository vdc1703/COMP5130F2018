**Assignment 2**

**Reason:**

Continuing with the assignment 1. After Bhavana Maradani showed us about her slides in class. I got an idea why I’m not add more function to the website. A visualization history chart displays how much money the nail salon made during the year and previous year. Also, a visual graph for each employee made during week/month/year would also be awesome. By that, my sister can have a visual look to see who do better and how to improve the customer service. 

**Solution:**

D3.js is a JavaScript library that use for visualizing data using web standards. It is free and easy to use, also, it compatible with PHP and MySQL which are the web framework that I’m going to use to buy my website.

**Plan:**

I’m going to create a simple website with all the basic functions working properly first before I move to the detail and how the website should look like. XAMPP is a free open source cross-platform web server. It supports both PHP and MySQL for Windows and Mac. This will my first start of the project.
